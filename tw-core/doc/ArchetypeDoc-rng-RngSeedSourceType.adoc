_possible values_:

[horizontal]
`RANDOM`:: The random number seed is produced from a call to a unique instance of `java.util.Random.Random()`. It uses time to the nanosecond to produce a ‘very likely to be distinct’ seed (default value)
`TABLE`:: The random number seed is taken as an element in a table of 1000 natural random numbers that have been obtained from atmospheric noise. Use the property `tableIndex` to specify which item in this table should be taken for the seed
