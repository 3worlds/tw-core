_possible values_:

[horizontal]
`permanent`:: relation stays as long as both its ends stay (default value)
`ephemeral`:: relations are created during a simulation by the means of a  `relateTo` function, and kept or deleted by means of a `maintainRelation` decision function. If no `maintainRelation` function is provided, then the relation only lasts for one simulation step.
