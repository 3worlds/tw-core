`RANDOM`:: selects system components randomly to constitute the sample (default value)
`FIRST`:: selects the first system components of their group (as internally stored) to constitute the sample. Notice that components may come in any order and that this order may change unpredictably during a simulation.
`LAST`:: selects the last system components of their group (as internally stored) to constitute the sample. Notice that components may come in any order and that this order may change unpredictably during a simulation.
